# FortiADC - Active/Active-VRRP

## Introduction

FortiADC is part of Fortinet's family of Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), designed to enhance the performance, availability, and security of enterprise applications.
It acts like an advanced load balancer, directing traffic to the most suitable backend servers using health checks and load-balancing algorithms.

In [HA-VRRP mode](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiadc/7.4.0/ha-deployment-guide/261403/ha-modes), resources are grouped to enable an active-active setup, where each HA node has its own IP and shares a "floating IP" within a VRRP group. Devices use this floating IP as their gateway, which shifts to a new Primary node if the current one fails, ensuring constant connectivity.

Typically, two VRRP groups are created, each managed by a different Primary node (FortiADC1 and FortiADC2) for load balancing. If a failure occurs in one group, the other node takes over, keeping traffic uninterrupted.

## Design

FortiADC Active/Active-VRRP environment consists of:

- 2 standalone FortiADC virtual machine with 2 NICs: external and internal.
- 1 VNETs containing 2 subnets: external and internal.
- 2 Standard public IPs attached to port1 interface for management in each VM.
- Network security group (NSG) which allows inbound HTTP, SSH, unicast HA heartbeat and HA configuration synchronization traffic.

## Configuration

**Configure HA on FortiADC1**
<code><pre>
config system ha
set mode active-active-vrrp
set hbdev port2
set datadev port2
set group-id 31
set local-node-id 1
set group-name azure_group
set config-priority 200
set override enable
set l7-persistence-pickup enable
set l4-persistence-pickup enable
set l4-session-pickup enable
set hb-type unicast
set local-address 172.16.136.69
set peer-address 172.16.136.70
end
</code></pre>

**Configure HA on FortiADC2**
<code><pre>
config system ha
set mode active-active-vrrp
set hbdev port2
set datadev port2
set group-id 31
set group-name azure_group
set override enable
set l7-persistence-pickup enable
set l4-persistence-pickup enable
set l4-session-pickup enable
set hb-type unicast
set local-address 172.16.136.70
set peer-address 172.16.136.69
end
</code></pre>
