## Introduction

IPv6 for Azure Virtual Network offers dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) connectivity, enabling seamless hosting of applications in Azure with both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity.
As the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses persists and new networks for mobility and IoT are built on IPv6, Azure's support for IPv6 becomes increasingly critical.
IPv6 connectivity in Azure allows for flexible deployment of VMs with load-balanced IPv6 connectivity, ensuring connectivity with both existing IPv4 networks and emerging IPv6 devices and networks. 
With features like custom IPv6 virtual network address space, dual-stack subnets, security measures, and load balancer support, Azure's IPv6 capabilities provide scalability, flexibility, and security for modern cloud deployments. 
While IPv6 support continues to expand across Azure services, limitations exist, but the benefits of adopting IPv6 in Azure Virtual Network outweigh these constraints, paving the way for future-ready cloud architectures.
For further insights into the benefits and limitations of IPv6 integration in Azure Virtual Network, please refer to the following link: [IPv6 Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview).

We will present two scenarios for dual-stack deployment with Fortigate in the subsequent sections. The first scenario illustrates deployment without an external load balancer, while the second scenario demonstrates deployment with a load balancer positioned in front of Fortigate.

## Deployment Scenarioes 

### Dual Stack Single-VM

In this scenario, our test environment comprises the following components:

Single-VM Fortigate with two interfaces: external and internal, each configured with dual-stack private IPs.
Dual-stack virtual network with corresponding dual-stack subnets: external, internal, and protected.
Public IPv6 and IPv4 addresses attached to the Fortigate's external interface.
Route table for the protected subnet: Following a similar deployment approach as in IPv4 for Fortigate, we include IPv6 routes in the User-Defined Routes (UDR) to direct traffic from protected subnets to the internal interface of Fortigate.

On the Fortigate, additional configurations are necessary:

Adding a default route and directing it to fe80::1234:5678:9abc.
Implementing IPv6 Virtual IP (VIP) alongside VIP for IPv4 to facilitate inbound connectivity.
Establishing firewall policies for both IPv4 and IPv6 to ensure comprehensive network security.

## Deployment

For the deployment, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Powershell or Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure ARM templates are exclusive to Microsoft Azure and can't be used in other cloud environments. The main template is the `azuredeploy.json` which you can use in the Azure Portal. A `deploy.sh` script is provided to facilitate the deployment. You'll be prompted to provide the 4 required variables:

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the template for ease of use and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed.
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

### Azure Portal

Azure Portal Wizard:
[![Azure Portal Wizard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2F40net-cloud%2Ffortinet-azure-solutions%2Fmain%2FFortiGate%2FA-Single-VM%2Fazuredeploy.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2F40net-cloud%2Ffortinet-azure-solutions%2Fmain%2FFortiGate%2FA-Single-VM%2FcreateUiDefinition.json)

### Azure CLI

To fast track the deployment, use the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is an in-browser CLI that contains Terraform and other tools for deployment into Microsoft Azure. It is accessible via the Azure Portal or directly at [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com). You can copy and paste the below one-liner to get started with your deployment.

```
cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/40net-cloud/fortinet-azure-solutions/archive/main.tar.gz | \
tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/fortinet-azure-solutions-main/FortiGate/A-Single-VM/ && ./deploy.sh
```

![Azure Cloud Shell](images/azure-cloud-shell.png)

After deployment, you will be shown the IP addresses of all deployed components. This information is also stored in the output directory in the 'summary.out' file. You can access both management GUI's using the public management IP addresses using HTTPS on port 443.

## Requirements and limitations

The ARM template deploys different resources and it is required to have the access rights and quota in your Microsoft Azure subscription to deploy the resources.

- The template will deploy Standard F2s VMs for this architecture. Other VM instances are supported as well with a minimum of 2 NICs. A list can be found [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate-public-cloud/7.4.0/azure-administration-guide/562841/instance-type-support)
- Licenses for FortiGate
  - BYOL: A demo license can be made available via your Fortinet partner or on our website. These can be injected during deployment or added after deployment. Purchased licenses need to be registered on the [Fortinet support site](http://support.fortinet.com). Download the .lic file after registration. Note, these files may not work until 60 minutes after it's initial creation.
  - PAYG or OnDemand: These licenses are automatically generated during the deployment of the FortiGate systems.
  - The password provided during deployment must need password complexity rules from Microsoft Azure:
  - It must be 12 characters or longer
  - It needs to contain characters from at least 3 of the following groups: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters excluding '\' or '-'
- The terms for the FortiGate PAYG or BYOL image in the Azure Marketplace needs to be accepted once before usage. This is done automatically during deployment via the Azure Portal. For the Azure CLI the commands below need to be run before the first deployment in a subscription.
  - BYOL
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm`
  - PAYG
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm_payg_2023`

## Configuration

The FortiGate VMs need a specific configuration to match the deployed environment. This configuration can be injected during provisioning or afterwards via the different options including GUI, CLI, FortiManager or REST API.

- [Default configuration using this template](doc/config-provisioning.md)
- [Upload VHD](../Documentation/faq-upload-vhd.md)

### Fabric Connector

The FortiGate-VM uses [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for the SDN Fabric Connector. A SDN Fabric Connector is created automatically during deployment. After deployment, it is required apply the 'Reader' role to the Azure Subscription you want to resolve Azure Resources from. More information can be found on the [Fortinet Documentation Libary](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate-public-cloud/7.2.0/azure-administration-guide/236610/configuring-an-sdn-connector-using-a-managed-identity).

## Support

Fortinet-provided scripts in this and other GitHub projects do not fall under the regular Fortinet technical support scope and are not supported by FortiCare Support Services.
