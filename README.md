# FortiSandbox - Basic Deployment

## Introduction

The FortiSandbox basic deployment model is the fastest and easiest way to deploy a FortiSandbox VM on Azure.


## Design

This ARM template deploys  FortiSandbox Vms accompanied by the required infrastructure in Basic mode. It will automatically deploy a full working environment containing the following components.

- FortiSandbox Vm
- 1 VNETs containing external subnet and transit subnet
- Public IP address attached to external NIC
