# FortiGate-VM Backup in Azure

## Introduction

Azure Backup does not currently support backing up FortiGate virtual machines (VMs).
This restriction applies to most third-party network virtual appliances (NVAs) deployed from the Azure Marketplace, including FortiGate instances.

For more information, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix-iaas).

To protect your FortiGate configurations and data, consider alternative backup methods such as:

- Backup configuration as described in the [official documentation](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.6.4/administration-guide/702257).

- Taking Azure-managed disk snapshots at scheduled intervals.

In this article, we will focus on disk-level backup options as an alternative to Azure Backup.

## Backup Procedure

- Create Backup Vault as described in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/create-manage-backup-vault)
- from backup vault under manage click on backup policies then add new policy

- click + from backup vault to start backup configuration.

- setect data resource type as azure disk

- select the Fortigate disks that you want to backup. then review the reuired rules
