# FortiGate Terraform modules for Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

This example Terraform code illustrates how to deploy FortiGate virtual machines with both external and internal Azure Load Balancers, using the module provided in the [modules directory](https://github.com/40net-cloud/terraform-azure-fortigate/tree/main/modules/active-active).

The goal is to streamline the deployment process for users and offer a more efficient method for managing the associated resources.

The outcome of this deployment is similar to the deployment [here](https://github.com/fortinet/azure-templates/tree/main/FortiGate/Active-Active-ELB-ILB#external-and-internal-azure-standard-load-balancer).

## Deployment

### Overview

The Terraform code provisions a resource group that includes the following resources:

- 2 to 8 FortiGate virtual machines, each configured with two network interfaces: one external and one internal
- External Azure Standard Load Balancer
- Internal Azure Standard Load Balancer
- VNET with an external and internal subnets
- NSG attached to internal and external interfaces for each FortiGate 
- A Public IP address used as the frontend IP for the external load balancer

### Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Navigate to the example directory (e.g., `examples/active-active-elb-ilb`).
2. Review variables defined in  `examples/active-active-elb-ilb/variables.tf` and ensure the all default values meet your requirements. Modify them as needed.
3. Rename the file `terraform.tfvars.txt` to `terraform.tfvars`.
4. Fill in the required variables in `terraform.tfvars` file.
5. Run the following commands:
<code><pre>
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
</code></pre>
